# AWSXMAIT
AWS x MAIT Collaboration Landing Page
üöÄ Project Overview
This project is a responsive, single-page landing site designed to showcase the strategic partnership between Amazon Web Services (AWS) and the Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology (MAIT). It serves as a central hub to communicate the program's vision, core activities, and latest updates to students and stakeholders.

‚≠ê Development Status
This project represents my first developed website! It was a major learning exercise in front-end development. While foundational steps were taken to ensure responsiveness using Flexbox and Tailwind CSS, the layout and styling, particularly on specific mobile phone screen sizes, may still require further refinement and optimization. All constructive feedback is highly appreciated as I continue to build my skills.

‚ú® Key Features
Fixed Header: A persistent, clean navigation bar featuring the AWS and MAIT logos, ensuring easy access to different sections of the page.

Hero Section: A visually impactful introduction using the AWS-inspired dark blue/orange color scheme (#212932 and #FF9900).

Partnership Pillars: Four distinct, color-coded cards highlighting the key benefits and focus areas of the collaboration (e.g., AWS Academy Integration, Hands-on Labs).

Scrolling Updates: A prominent marquee section dedicated to displaying recent announcements, recruitment tasks, and event links.

Responsive Layout: The page is fully responsive, utilizing modern CSS (Flexbox) to ensure optimal viewing on both mobile and desktop devices.

Flexible About Us Section: The "About Us" content and its associated visual icon/image are positioned side-by-side on larger screens and stack neatly on smaller devices.

üõ† Technologies Used
HTML5: Semantic structure for the page content.

CSS: Custom CSS for unique styling, colors, and layout foundations.

Tailwind CSS (CDN): Used for advanced responsiveness, utility-first styling, and ensuring component alignment across different screen sizes.

üé® Design and Styling Notes
The design follows a modern, professional aesthetic aligned with the partners' branding:

Primary Colors: AWS Orange (#FF9900) and Dark Blue/Black (#212932).

Typography: Primary font is Arial/Inter for readability.

Card Design: Cards feature prominent colored top borders to visually separate the four key features.

Flexbox Layout: Flexbox is extensively used, particularly in the navigation bar and the "About Us" section, to achieve precise horizontal and vertical alignments.
